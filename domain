Domain is served on localhost on http://school-board.test/ as instructed, if needed I can upload app to my own cloud server.

Steps:
Add school-board.test to /etc/hosts

Create school-board.conf file in /etc/nginx/sites-available

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name school-board.test;
    root /var/www/html/school-board;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    charset utf-8;
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}

 location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}

RUN: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/school-board.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

Restart nginx & fpm services
